        <p>I declare that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I'm studying a pre-registration health professional course which is eligible for the NHS Bursary
          </li>
          <li>I've read and understood relevant guidance and related information about the conditions for claiming
            an NHS Bursary</li>
          <li>I'll give NHSBSA Student Services any additional information they may reasonably need to verify the
            information I've given on my application</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Sharing your information</h2>
        <p>For verification purposes and compliance with Data Protection law, we may share your information with:</p>

          <li>NHSBSA software suppliers</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I understand that the information I provided about my income and expenses may be shared with these
          organisations to prevent, detect and investigate fraud.</p>
        <p>To prevent, detect, investigate, and prosecute fraud or other unlawful activity affecting the NHS, we may

        </ul>

        <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Changes to circumstances or attendance</h2>
        <p>I accept that NHSBSA Student Services will immediately stop or suspend my funding if:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I withdraw, abandon, suspend, defer, or interrupt my course for any reason either permanently or
            temporarily, regardless of whether I intend to return</li>
          <li>I take a year or term out from studying</li>
          <li>I gain financial support from a publicly funded body - excluding the Student Loans Company, government
            benefit agencies, and hardship loans or bursaries from my Higher Education Institution</li>
          <li>NHSBSA Student Services in its absolute discretion decides that I'm no longer entitled to financial
            support and it's reasonable to withdraw funding</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I'll notify NHSBSA Student Services immediately of any change in circumstances that might affect my
          entitlement to financial support or their records relating to me, including but not limited to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>changing my study pattern from full time to part time, or vice versa</li>
          <li>withdrawing, abandoning, suspending, deferring, or interrupting my course for any reason either
            permanently or temporarily, regardless of whether I intend to return</li>
          <li>taking a year or term out from studying</li>
          <li>changing the bank account I want my payments made to</li>
          <li>changing address</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I understand and accept that if I fail to notify NHSBSA Student Services of any change to my bank or building
          society account details in sufficient time, or provide incorrect information, NHSBSA Student Services cannot
          take responsibility for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>payments made to an incorrect account</li>
          <li>delayed payments</li>
          <li>payments not being made</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Repayments</h2>
        <p>We're committed to accurately administering entitlement where possible. I agree to pay back NHSBSA
          Student Services any excess payment, fees, and any other charges within 30 days of being notified. Related
          circumstances include, but are not limited to, if:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I change my study pattern from full time to part time, or vice versa</li>
          <li>withdrawing, abandoning, suspending, deferring, or interrupting my course for any reason either
            permanently or temporarily, regardless of whether I intend to return</li>
          <li>taking a year or term out from studying</li>
          <li>I've been overpaid because I failed to notify NHSBSA Student Services of a change in my
            circumstances</li>
          <li>NHSBSA Student Services in its absolute discretion decides I've received funding I'm not
            entitled to</li>
          <li>I gain financial support from a publicly funded body - excluding the Student Loans Company, government
            benefit agencies, and my Higher Education Institution</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I understand that if I fail to fully repay any amount due or agree on an acceptable repayment plan with
          NHSBSA, the debt and relevant personal information may pass to a debt collection agency. I also understand
          that I will be charged for any additional recovery cost at the rate of 8% on the referred debt.</p>

        <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Social Work Bursary</h2>
        <p>I understand NHSBSA is responsible for administrating the NHS Bursary and the NHS Counter Fraud Authority is
          responsible for countering fraud.</p>
        <p>I understand and accept that the terms and conditions (including rates) for the NHS Bursary may change at any
          time without notice, and the scheme is subject to continued government funding, which may stop at any time
          without notice.</p>
        <p>I understand if I fail to notify NHSBSA Student Services that I have withdrawn, abandoned, suspended,
          deferred or interrupted my course for any reason either permanently or temporarily, I may be referred to the
          NHSBSA Loss and Fraud Prevention Team for failure to disclose information and obtaining money I'm not
          entitled to.</p>
        <p>I declare the information I've given on this form and in any supporting documents is complete and
          accurate. I understand and accept that if I give NHSBSA Student Services false or misleading information, they
          may refuse or withdraw financial support. I may also be liable to criminal prosecution, civil proceedings, or
          both.</p>
        <p>You'll need to re-accept this declaration for any future changes to this application.</p>
