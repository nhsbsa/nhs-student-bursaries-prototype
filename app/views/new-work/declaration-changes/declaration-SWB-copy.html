        <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Changes to circumstances or attendance</h2>
        <p>I accept that NHSBSA Student Services will immediately stop or suspend my funding if:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I withdraw, abandon, suspend, defer, or interrupt my course for any reason either permanently or
            temporarily, regardless of whether I intend to return</li>
          <li>I gain financial support from other sources which may affect my entitlement</li>
          <li>NHSBSA Student Services in its absolute discretion decides that I'm no longer entitled to financial
            support and it's reasonable to withdraw funding</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I understand and accept that if I fail to notify NHSBSA Student Services of any change to my bank or building
          society account details in sufficient time, or provide incorrect information, NHSBSA Student Services cannot
          take responsibility for:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>payments made to an incorrect account</li>
          <li>delayed payments</li>
          <li>payments not being made</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Repayments</h2>
        <p>We're committed to accurately administering entitlement where possible. I agree to pay back NHSBSA
          Student Services any excess payment, fees, and any other charges within 30 days of being notified. Related
          circumstances include, but are not limited to, if:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I change my study pattern or course attendance in any way</li>
          <li>I withdraw, abandon, suspend, defer, or interrupt my course for any reason either permanently or
            temporarily, regardless of whether I intend to return</li>
          <li>I've been overpaid because I failed to notify NHSBSA Student Services of a change in my
            circumstances</li>
          <li>I gain financial support from other sources which may affect my entitlement</li>
          <li>NHSBSA Student Services in its absolute discretion decides I've received funding I'm not
            entitled to</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I understand that if I fail to fully repay any amount due or agree on an acceptable repayment plan with
          NHSBSA, the debt will pass to a debt collection agency. I also understand that I may be charged for any
          additional recovery costs, interest, or both, at the rate of 8% on the referred debt. This may be added to the
          overall balance.</p>

        <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Social Work Bursary</h2>
        <p>I understand the NHSBSA is responsible for administrating the Social Work Bursary and for counter fraud and
          security management in the NHS.</p>
        <p>I understand that the Social Work Bursary places are capped and that my university or college is responsible
          for allocating these. I also understand that even if I am eligible for a Social Work Bursary, I may only
          receive a Placement Travel Allowance if my university or college does not allocate me a capped place.</p>
        <p>I have read and accepted the <a
            href="https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/our-policies/privacy/student-services-privacy-notice">NHSBSA Student
            Services privacy notice</a>.</p>
        <p>I understand and accept that the terms and conditions (including rates) for the Social Work Bursary may
          change at any time without notice, and the scheme is subject to continued government funding which may stop at
          any time without notice.</p>
        <p>I understand if I fail to notify NHSBSA Student Services that I have withdrawn, abandoned, suspended,
          deferred or interrupted my course for any reason either permanently or temporarily, I may be referred to the
          NHSBSA Loss and Fraud Prevention Team for failure to disclose information and obtaining money I'm not
          entitled to.</p>
        <p>I declare the information I've given on this form and in any supporting documents is complete and
          accurate. I understand and accept that if I give NHSBSA Student Services false or misleading information, they
          may refuse or withdraw financial support. I may also be liable to criminal prosecution, civil proceedings, or
          both.</p>
